    summary: |
      An opaque representation of the authentication configuration. 
    conceptual: |
      Applications use factory functions to provide the authentication parameters (for example, a raw access token). The factory function encapsulates the parameters in an instance of this class. The interface in this class is (intentionally) very narrow. Only the internal components in the client libraries should need to access the details of this class.
